# NeonLyra

Lyra is a lisp I make for fun and learning. NeonLyra is an improved version.

Current version: 0.0.1

Inspired by Scheme, Clojure, Haskell, Ruby and the text on my coffee cub.

## Goals and priorities:

- Having fun

## Differences to original Lyra:

- No `set-car!` or `set-cdr!` and no mutating functions for vectors.  
- No shying away from using more native functions.  
- Lists have a size. To count the elements, it does not have to be iterated.  
- User-defined types use native functions.  
- A module system.  

## Features:

- Different numeric types: Integer and Float  
- Macros  
- Tail recursion  
- Lazy evaluation (not implemented)  

## Types:

- Symbol  
- Basic numbers: Integer, Float  
- String  
- List (car, cdr, size)  
- Boolean (#t, #f)  
- Function  
- Vector (not implemented)  
- Map (not implemented)  
- Maybe (not implemented)  
- Lazy (not implemented)  
- Box (The only mutable type) (not implemented)  



## Changelog:

0.0.1 The thing works but lacks functionality.
